# üéÆ Create Your Own Simple Game in Java

Welcome to an exciting journey of crafting a simple game application from scratch! This task will guide you through creating a game that incorporates player movement, a scoring system, and interactions with enemies. As you embark on this journey, you'll enhance your skills in navigating documentation, reading from text files, and effectively using Java's `HashMap` class.

## üìù Task Overview

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, involves the following core components:

1. **Player Movement:** Implement basic player controls to navigate through the game environment.
2. **Scoring System:** Develop a mechanism to track and display the player's score.
3. **Enemy Interactions:** Create basic enemy behaviors that interact with the player, affecting game mechanics such as scoring or game state.

## üöÄ Learning Goals

- **Using Documentation:** Master the art of navigating official Java documentation to understand and implement classes and libraries effectively.
- **Reading from a Text File:** Gain proficiency in file I/O operations in Java, focusing on reading data from text files effectively.
- **Using the `HashMap` Class:** Dive into the intricacies of the `HashMap` class for storing and retrieving key-value pairs efficiently.

## üìö Detailed Exercises

### Exercise 1: Understanding Java Documentation üìÑ

**Objective:** Develop an understanding of navigating Java's official documentation and API references.

- **Task:** Explore Java's `String` class documentation (https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html). Identify at least three methods you find intriguing and explain how they might be useful in game development.
- **Reflection:** What challenges did you face while navigating the documentation, and how did you overcome them?

----

### Exercise 2: File I/O Concepts in Java üóÇÔ∏è

**Objective:** Comprehend how Java handles file input operations.

- **Task:** Explain the difference between `FileReader` and `BufferedReader` classes in Java. Why is using `BufferedReader` often considered more efficient?
- **Reflection:** Imagine a scenario in your game where you need to read the player's saved score from a file. How would you approach this task?

----

### Exercise 3: Implement Basic Player Movement üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**Objective:** Translate theoretical concepts into coding practice by implementing player movement.

- **Code Task:** Create a `Player` class with fields for position (`x`, `y` coordinates). Implement methods to move the player up, down, left, and right based on simple command inputs.

  ```java
  public class Player {
      private int x;
      private int y;

      public Player(int startX, int startY) {
          this.x = startX;
          this.y = startY;
      }

      public void moveUp() { y--; }
      public void moveDown() { y++; }
      public void moveLeft() { x--; }
      public void moveRight() { x++; }

      public int getX() { return x; }
      public int getY() { return y; }
  }
  ```

- **Reflection:** How did you determine the change in coordinates for each movement?

----

### Exercise 4: Score Management with Files and `HashMap` üìä

**Objective:** Integrate file reading and `HashMap` to manage and update a player's score.

- **Code Task:** Create a method to read the player's previous scores from a file. Use a `HashMap` where the key is the player name and the value is their score.

  ```java
  public class ScoreManager {
      private HashMap<String, Integer> scores;

      public ScoreManager(String filename) {
          scores = new HashMap<>();
          try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filename))) {
              String line;
              while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
                  String[] parts = line.split(":");
                  scores.put(parts[0], Integer.parseInt(parts[1]));
              }
          } catch (IOException e) {
              e.printStackTrace();
          }
      }

      public Integer getScore(String playerName) {
          return scores.getOrDefault(playerName, 0);
      }
  }
  ```

- **Reflection:** How did the use of `HashMap` simplify managing player scores?

----

### Exercise 5: Developing Enemy Interactions üëæ

**Objective:** Implement basic enemy interactions affecting player score or status.

- **Code Task:** Expand the game to include an `Enemy` class that interacts with the `Player`. Implement a simple collision detection on the grid, deducting points when the player encounters an enemy.

  ```java
  public class Enemy {
      private int x;
      private int y;

      public Enemy(int startX, int startY) {
          this.x = startX;
          this.y = startY;
      }

      public boolean checkCollision(Player player) {
          return this.x == player.getX() && this.y == player.getY();
      }
  }
  ```

- **Reflection:** Reflect on the challenges of implementing collision detection in a grid-based environment.

----

### Exercise 6: Integrating All Components into a Simple Game Framework üéÆ

**Objective:** Synthesize all previous exercises to create a functional basic game prototype.

- **Code Task:** Incorporate all the developed components (Player movement, score management, enemy interactions) into a main game loop. Implement a way to visualize the player's and enemy's positions and track score changes.

  ```java
  public class Game {
      private Player player;
      private Enemy enemy;
      private ScoreManager scoreManager;

      public Game() {
          player = new Player(0, 0);
          enemy = new Enemy(5, 5);
          scoreManager = new ScoreManager("scores.txt");
      }

      public void gameLoop() {
          // Example loop, could use more elaborate input handling
          player.moveRight();
          if (enemy.checkCollision(player)) {
              System.out.println("Collision detected! Losing points.");
              // Deduct points logic
          }
          // Update score and display game state
      }
  }
  ```

- **Reflection:** How did integrating multiple components into a single game loop challenge your problem-solving skills? What debugging strategies worked best for you?
